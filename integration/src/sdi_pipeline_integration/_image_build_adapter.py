"""Implemented image-build Stage adapter: build each placement's recipe.

For every placement in the deployment schema, the adapter builds the Dockerfile
the placed artifact names, for every architecture the artifact declares,
against the stack's one BuildKit daemon, and pushes one image per placement to
the stack-local pipeline registry. It records each placement built, with its
image digests, or failed, with one reason from a closed set. The Domain outcome
is succeeded whenever every placement is recorded, even when nothing built.

The adapter runs on the image-build agent with only PATH and LC_ALL in its
environment, so the builder and registry addresses are constants.
