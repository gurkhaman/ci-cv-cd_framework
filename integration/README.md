# Pipeline Integration Package

This independent `uv` project owns the supported `sdi-integration` CLI and the
deep `sdi_pipeline_integration` package boundary. The CLI, committed file
contracts, and the language-neutral Stage-adapter process interface are the
supported interfaces. Internal Python modules are not compatibility contracts.

Run all checks through `scripts/verify` rather than using an ambient Python
environment.

Tests marked `live` call a real model provider; tests marked `slow` wait out a
real work limit or deadline. `scripts/verify` runs every test except the
`cv_engine` tests: the non-`slow` tests in parallel, then the `slow` tests
serially, because parallel load can push their timing past its bounds. For a
fast check while developing, run from this directory:

```sh
uv sync --frozen --all-groups
uv run pytest -m "not live and not slow and not cv_engine" -n auto --dist worksteal
```

Tests marked `cv_engine` run real S-04 compositions in a Docker-in-Docker
engine and its registry. They build every image they need inside that engine,
which takes tens of minutes when the engine is cold. Run them only on request,
with `SDI_CV_ENGINE_URL` and `SDI_CV_REGISTRY_URL` naming the engine pair:

```sh
uv run pytest -m cv_engine -v
```

When those tests are selected and the engine or registry does not answer, the
session stops with a non-zero exit before any test runs.

## Identify A Committed Run

`identify-run` reads the request and every referenced input directly from one
resolved Git commit. It accepts only the protected-main dispatch ref and never
reads dirty or staged worktree content:

```sh
uv run --project integration sdi-integration identify-run \
  --repository . \
  --requested-ref refs/heads/main \
  --resolved-commit "$GITHUB_SHA" \
  --run-request-path runs/s-04/s-04-tc-03-c-05-fixture.yaml
```

The repository must have one uncredentialed GitHub `origin` URL. Successful
validation emits one JSON record containing a newly assigned lowercase UUIDv4
Execution ID and exact-byte provenance. Validation failures exit with status 2,
write no record, and assign no Execution ID.

## Execute One Stage

`execute-stage` identifies the committed run, selects its reviewed adapter
descriptor, verifies that its Stage profile equals the one rendered from the
slot registry, and invokes the adapter
through the one-shot process interface. It accepts declared files only after the
complete candidate bundle, response correlation, file limits, and Domain schemas
validate:

```sh
uv run --project integration sdi-integration execute-stage \
  --repository . \
  --requested-ref refs/heads/main \
  --resolved-commit "$GITHUB_SHA" \
  --run-request-path runs/s-04/s-04-tc-03-c-05-fixture.yaml \
  --descriptor-path deployment/jenkins/adapters/composition-v1.yaml \
  --service-repository service-repository \
  --attempt-root artifacts/composition-attempt
```

Composition is granted every run-supplied input, and image-build and CV only
the service repository, where the recipes and descriptions live. `execute-stage`
requires `--service-repository` for composition, image-build and CV, rejects
`--composition-config` and `--generator` for any Stage but composition, and
rejects all three for CD. `execute-jenkins-stage` takes no
`--service-repository`: a Stage granted the service repository reads
`service-repository/` from the checked-out commit, and only composition accepts
the other two. `dispatch-local` runs both
Stages, so it always requires `--service-repository`. The Jenkins preflight
takes only `--composition-config` and `--generator`, to check the config's key
names, and `finalize-jenkins-run` takes none of them.
`--service-repository` names a directory of service folders, each holding its
`<service_id>/SDI.md` description and any recipes; the runtime copies every
regular file in the service folders into the Stage's inputs and gives the
adapter a manifest of their paths, sizes, and digests. It skips files
at the directory's root and refuses a folder without `SDI.md`, dotfiles and other
unsupported names, symbolic links, non-regular files, and more than 256 files or
1 MiB. Only each folder's `SDI.md` is a description.
`--composition-config` is a repository path read at the resolved commit and
defaults to `integration/composition-config.yaml`
(`sdi.composition-config/v1`), so a run can only pair a reviewed model endpoint
with the key variable that config names. The config names each generator with
its model, limits, context budget, endpoint and key variable, the
`default_generator`, and the `discovery` settings every generator shares. A run
uses the default generator (luna) unless `--generator NAME` names another the
config defines; an unknown name stops the run before launch. Nothing probes an
endpoint or falls back to another generator. The runtime resolves the config to
one declared, digest-checked input, `composition-settings.json`
(`sdi.composition-settings/v1`): the config's path and SHA-256, the selected
generator's name and settings, and the shared discovery settings. The committed
`qwen` generator is a self-hosted endpoint that keeps live tests cheap; it is not
a product choice. Discovery still embeds with OpenAI, so a qwen run also needs
`OPENAI_API_KEY`.

The adapter process exposes only:

```sh
sdi-composition-adapter run \
  --request request.json \
  --input-root inputs \
  --output-root candidate
```

## Implemented Composition

The composition descriptor selects `sdi-composition-adapter` with
`implementation_mode: implemented`. The adapter validates the copied
descriptions, discovers the ones the mission needs, asks the configured model
for proposals over those, assesses them against the whole repository with the
same rules as `assess-proposals`, and publishes the preferred proposal as the
composition blueprint and deployment schema. The preferred proposal supports the
most requirements, then has the fewest gaps; no performance evidence is
available, so equal proposals keep the model's order. The blueprint records the
`proposal_id` and each requirement's checked coverage status; each placement is
`resolved` or `unresolved`. A placement stays unresolved when its host omits the
device list or baseline the service's artifact needs. Both files and the
evidence carry the target profile's provenance basis as `profile_basis`, so a
placeholder profile stays labelled.

Discovery queries the service repository once per requirement, with its ID and
original Shall statement, and once with the profile's architectures, devices,
baselines and orchestrator interfaces. SQLite FTS5 BM25 ranks every
description's title, interfaces and body; when the composition config's
`discovery` has an `embeddings` block, cosine similarity over that endpoint's
embeddings ranks them too, and reciprocal rank fusion merges the two. The
committed config embeds with OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` for every
generator, so every generator ranks descriptions the same way. The orchestrator's inputs, then
each query's top three services in turn, are admitted along with every service
that provides one of their inputs or that their `depends_on` names. Admission
stops at the selected generator's `max_context_bytes`, a model-capacity limit,
and nothing fills the rest, so the model sees and may choose only the selected
descriptions. Without an `embeddings` block discovery is lexical only. With one,
an unset key or a failed embeddings call fails the run before generation, unless
`embeddings.on_unavailable: lexical` allows lexical-only discovery; the Stage's
reason summary and the `generate-proposals` stderr then say so, besides
`discovery.dense.status`.

The runtime forwards only the selected generator's key variable and the
embeddings key variable, and only when the descriptor's `secret_bindings` lists
them; otherwise `dispatch-local` and the Jenkins preflight reject the run before
any Stage starts. Each client reads only the key
paired with its own endpoint, so a generator's key never reaches the embeddings
endpoint and the embeddings key never reaches a generator. `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`, and `SSL_CERT_FILE` are forwarded when
set. A candidate holding the forwarded key's exact bytes is rejected.

| `sdi.composition.provider-error` | failed | not evaluated | diagnostic |

Discovery fails with no result when no query retrieves any description, and
over budget when it retrieved some but none fits `max_context_bytes`; the
diagnostic counts the descriptions selected, omitted and left out for the
budget. A bounded result means generation reached `max_output_tokens`. A scoped
rejection means every proposal lost all of its services to placement removals.
`composition-evidence.json` (`sdi.composition-evidence/v1`, at most 256 KiB)
records the repository's description digests, the discovery trace, the
`composition_config_sha256`, the selected generator's name and resolved
settings, the exact model request and response summary, and the
complete assessment with its ranking order and, for each other eligible
proposal, the criterion that ranked it lower. The discovery trace holds each
query, its top ten fused, lexical and dense ranks, every selected description
with its reason and size, every omitted one with its reason (`not retrieved` or
`budget`), the input references left unexpanded, and the budget used. When no
proposal is preferred and discovery omitted descriptions, the assessment reason
says the result holds within the bounded supplied context. It is never an input
to a later Stage. Each assessed service carries its chosen artifact's `route` as
declared. A route is provenance only and does not describe what the artifact's
`dockerfile:` recipe builds. A `mutable-artifact` finding marks a route that may
install different content later: any apt route, an image without a digest, or a
source revision that is not a full commit. It is read from the declared route only, never
resolved against a registry, and never counts as a gap. Reading the repository
fails rather than truncates at its limits, so the digests omit no description.
Reason summaries and the diagnostic come from fixed templates
and never repeat provider error text. Once the composition config is read, the
diagnostic names its digest and the selected generator, model, reasoning effort,
output limit, effective timeout and context budget, so a failed attempt still
records the settings it ran with. A failed attempt publishes no evidence, and
its diagnostic says so.

Fixture cases match exact input digests and cannot recognize real output, so a
Fixture Stage whose inputs include implemented output is skipped with
`sdi.dependency.implemented-evidence`. A successful composition therefore ends
a `dispatch-local` run with image build skipped and CV and CD blocked; the run
still exits 0. In the other direction, an implemented Stage whose inputs include
unevaluated Fixture output is skipped with `sdi.dependency.fixture-evidence`,
which turns the run red. The test-only chain of Fixture composition and Fixture
image build ends that way at CV.

## Image-build Adapter

`sdi-image-build-adapter` runs only in Jenkins, on the image-build agent,
because the builder exists only inside the stack; `dispatch-local` keeps the
Fixture. For each placement it builds the placed artifact's `dockerfile:`
recipe, with the service folder as build context, for every architecture the
artifact declares (`noarch` means amd64 and arm64), one `buildctl` client per
placement against `tcp://buildkitd:1234`, and pushes
`registry:5000/sdi/<service_id>:<artifact_id>-<execution id>`. Both addresses are
constants, since the adapter's environment holds only `PATH` and `LC_ALL`;
`buildctl` itself gets a fixed environment with an empty home and Docker config.
An unresolved placement fails `unresolved-placement`; an artifact without a
recipe, or whose recipe is not a captured file, fails `no-recipe`. A build fails
`build-failed` when any architecture fails, when it reports no digest, or when
the index read back from the registry does not match the digest or the requested
platforms. Builds still running at the work limit minus 60 seconds are sent
SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 15 seconds, and fail `work-limit`. Each failure
`detail` is the build log's last line once URLs, machine paths and private
addresses are masked, and the diagnostic adds a fair share of each failed log's
redacted tail.

| Outcome code | Execution | Domain outcome | Published |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sdi.image-build.recorded` | succeeded | succeeded | image-build result |
| `sdi.image-build.input-mismatch` | failed | not evaluated | diagnostic |
| `sdi.image-build.too-many-placements` | failed | not evaluated | diagnostic |
| `sdi.image-build.builder-unreachable` | failed | not evaluated | diagnostic |
| `sdi.image-build.registry-unreachable` | failed | not evaluated | diagnostic |
| `sdi.image-build.arm64-unavailable` | failed | not evaluated | diagnostic |

`recorded` means every placement was judged, even when nothing built; it does
not mean any image is available. The input mismatch is a service repository
whose digest differs from the deployment schema's, and the placement limit is
48. The builder, registry and arm64 checks run only when some placement is
buildable, so a run with nothing to build never touches the builder. In Jenkins,
a successful composition is followed by a real image build, after which CV runs
the composition from the pushed images and the CD Fixture skips with
`sdi.dependency.implemented-evidence`. A runtime hard timeout kills the adapter
and its clients together and leaves its scratch directory on the agent's `/tmp`
tmpfs until the agent restarts.

## CV Adapter

`sdi-cv-adapter` runs only in Jenkins, on the `cv` agent, against the stack's
CV engine at `tcp://cv-engine:2375`. It judges one composition in one attempt,
in one headless Gazebo scenario, and records one verdict.

Before it opens a Docker client, the adapter checks every placement's
declarations. For each service it records the first of these causes:

1. The image-build result records no built image: `image-unavailable`.
2. The built image has no linux/amd64 platform: `no-amd64`.
3. The service declares a GPU, or a device other than `opencr`, `lidar`,
   `camera` and `microphone`: `needs-gpu-or-device`.
4. A service without devices has no counting output: `no-counting-output`.

A counting output is a topic that the service declares in `publishes`. A topic
that another composed service also declares does not count, and neither does a
topic in CV's topic constant, which the scenario machinery publishes itself. Any
cause makes the composition not evaluated, and every other service is
`blocked`.

When every placement passes, the adapter builds the sim image if the engine
does not have it, and pulls each image by its amd64 digest. It then starts the
sim, one container per placement, and the mission orchestrator, and waits for
the orchestrator to finish. A failed pull is `image-unavailable`. An image
command that is neither `ros2 launch` nor `ros2 run` is `unsupported-command`. A
counting type that the orchestrator cannot load is `unloadable-type`. Each of
these causes also makes the composition not evaluated.

A service participates when its container still runs when the orchestrator
exits, and at least one message arrived on one of its counting outputs. A
service whose devices Gazebo stands in for only has to keep running, and its
evidence records `participated_loosened`. The composition succeeds when every
service participated and every mission step passed or was scripted. Otherwise
it fails. The summary names the first service that did not participate, or else
the first mission step that failed or timed out.

| Outcome code | Execution | Domain outcome | Category | Published |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sdi.cv.succeeded` | succeeded | succeeded | no reason | Validation evidence |
| `sdi.cv.failed` | succeeded | failed | domain | Validation evidence |
| `sdi.cv.not-evaluated` | succeeded | not evaluated | dependency | Validation evidence |
| `sdi.cv.engine-unreachable` | failed | not evaluated | dependency | diagnostic |
| `sdi.cv.pull-failed` | failed | not evaluated | dependency | diagnostic |
| `sdi.cv.input-mismatch` | failed | not evaluated | input | diagnostic |
| `sdi.cv.unsupported-robot` | failed | not evaluated | input | diagnostic |
| `sdi.cv.sim-build-failed` | failed | not evaluated | tool | diagnostic |
| `sdi.cv.no-time-to-start` | failed | not evaluated | tool | diagnostic |
| `sdi.cv.start-failed` | failed | not evaluated | tool | diagnostic |
| `sdi.cv.orchestrator-timeout` | failed | not evaluated | tool | diagnostic |
| `sdi.cv.sim-not-running` | failed | not evaluated | tool | diagnostic |
| `sdi.cv.no-result` | failed | not evaluated | tool | diagnostic |
| `sdi.cv.result-too-large` | failed | not evaluated | tool | diagnostic |
| `sdi.cv.invalid-result` | failed | not evaluated | tool | diagnostic |
| `sdi.cv.evidence-too-large` | failed | not evaluated | tool | diagnostic |

A pass reports no reason. The diagnostic's first line names
`sdi.cv.succeeded`. A failed verdict turns the run red, and a not-evaluated
verdict leaves it green. The input mismatch is a service repository whose digest
differs from the blueprint's. The unsupported robot is a target other than the
TurtleBot3 Waffle and Burger. `diagnostic.txt` records the phase times, the
setup and each mission step with its elapsed seconds, each service's
participation, the message counts, the topic-constant check, and the ROS graph
grouped by publisher set. Log tails of the containers that explain the outcome
share the space that is left.

Locally, CV never runs. After a successful composition it is blocked, and the
Fixture chain's output makes it skip with `sdi.dependency.fixture-evidence`.

## Dispatch A Local Run

`dispatch-local` assigns one Execution ID, executes the reviewed composition,
image-build, CV, and CD descriptors sequentially, and passes only exact accepted
files along the least-required graph. It atomically publishes a complete archive
candidate only after all attempts, Domain outputs, evidence, diagnostics, result
metadata, and checksums validate:

```sh
uv run --project integration sdi-integration dispatch-local \
  --repository . \
  --requested-ref refs/heads/main \
  --resolved-commit "$GITHUB_SHA" \
  --run-request-path runs/s-04/s-04-tc-03-c-05-fixture.yaml \
  --service-repository service-repository \
  --bundle-root artifacts/s-04-tc-03-c-05
```

Export `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which luna and the embeddings use. To spend less while
the self-hosted endpoint serves, add `--generator qwen` and also export
`VLLM_KEY`. The result is the manifest; its checksummed inventory covers every
other archive file without a recursive self-digest. Revalidate the complete
archive independently with:

```sh
uv run --project integration sdi-integration validate-bundle \
  --bundle-root artifacts/s-04-tc-03-c-05
```

Locally, image build and CD are Fixtures and CV does not run. The result
explicitly records
`kpi_evaluation: not_evaluated` and contains no overall Domain or
six-combination verdict.

## Jenkins Pipeline Operations

The root `Jenkinsfile` composes five public CLI operations rather than parsing or
constructing contracts in Groovy:

- `preflight-jenkins-run` takes `--integration-node` and
  `--integration-baked-code-digest`, plus `--stage-node STAGE=NODE` and
  `--stage-baked-code-digest STAGE=DIGEST` once per Stage. It first compares
  the integration code digest each of the five agent images recorded at build
  time with the digest of the submitted checkout. It then preserves the
  submitted Execution ID and revalidates the seven scalar handoff values,
  committed inputs, all descriptors and Stage profiles, and the allocated
  resource mapping.
- `execute-jenkins-stage --stage STAGE` first repeats that digest comparison
  for its own agent. It then reconstructs prior accepted attempts from bounded
  Jenkins stashes, validates every transferred byte, and executes the Stage's
  reviewed Jenkins descriptor from the Stage registry on its matching immutable
  agent under the work limit of the Stage's grant. An expired run deadline
  returns control without launching an adapter so integration-owned
  finalization can create the typed skip.
- `attempt-allows-continuation` derives whether another Domain Stage may run.
- `finalize-jenkins-run` creates typed downstream skips, assembles the exact
  archive, and validates it on the integration agent.
- `bundle-conclusion` revalidates the bundle and derives the run's colour. The
  run is red when Jenkins machinery failed, when CV failed the composition, or
  when CD failed to deploy it.
  Any other valid negative Domain outcome, and a composition that CV did not
  evaluate, keeps it green. `dispatch-local` exits with the same colour.

A digest mismatch exits with status 4 and the reason
`sdi.agent.stale-image`, naming the stale agents, before any Stage work. When
the integration agent itself is stale, it names only that agent, because its
digest of the checkout cannot be trusted. `integration-code-digest --root
<integration directory>` prints the digest over `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`,
`src`, and `fixtures`, which the agent image build records in
`/etc/sdi/integration-code-digest`.

The `Jenkinsfile` reads the run limit and each Stage's name, agent label,
safety timeout, and credentials from a block rendered from the Stage registry.
After editing the registry, run this from the repository root:

```sh
uv run --project integration sdi-integration jenkinsfile --write --jenkinsfile Jenkinsfile
```

`jenkinsfile --check` fails while the block is stale, and `scripts/verify` runs
it beside the schema and Stage-profile checks. `adapter-image --repository .
--stage STAGE`, repeated once per Stage, prints the runtime image of each
Stage's Jenkins adapter descriptor, one per line in argument order; `bin/stack`
selects the agent images with it.

These commands are pipeline-facing primitives. Operators submit only through the
fixed Jenkins job; they do not manually coordinate the primitives or reuse their
temporary directories as result authority.

## Handoff One Run To Jenkins

`handoff-jenkins` is the repository-owned transport seam used by the protected
GitHub workflow. It revalidates an already identified committed run,
performs an authenticated Jenkins preflight, submits the seven accepted scalar
parameters, follows the returned queue item to its exact executable build, and
retrieves only that build's declared archive:

```sh
uv run --project integration sdi-integration handoff-jenkins \
  --repository . \
  --requested-ref refs/heads/main \
  --resolved-commit "$GITHUB_SHA" \
  --run-request-path runs/s-04/s-04-tc-03-c-01-fixture.yaml \
  --execution-id "$EXECUTION_ID" \
  --github-run-id "$GITHUB_RUN_ID" \
  --github-run-attempt "$GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT" \
  --bundle-root artifacts/bundle \
  --receipt-path artifacts/handoff-receipt.json
```

The Jenkins endpoint, fixed job, repository identity, machine username, API
token, and safety limits are trusted environment configuration rather than
command arguments or workflow inputs. The required settings are
`SDI_JENKINS_BASE_URL`, `SDI_JENKINS_JOB_PATH`, `SDI_JENKINS_REPOSITORY`,
`SDI_JENKINS_USERNAME`, and `SDI_JENKINS_API_TOKEN`. Plain HTTP is accepted only
for loopback hosts and exactly the host `controller`, which the stack runner
reaches over its internal network; relocated Jenkins endpoints require verified
HTTPS. The command
does not support passwords, crumbs, remote-trigger tokens, URL credentials, or
redirects. Preflight verifies the authenticated machine identity and access to
the configured fixed job before submission.

The independently configurable safety settings and repository defaults are:

| Setting | Default | Scope |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `SDI_HANDOFF_HTTP_LIMIT_SECONDS` | 30 | One HTTP operation |
| `SDI_HANDOFF_SUBMISSION_LIMIT_SECONDS` | 30 | Build submission |
| `SDI_HANDOFF_QUEUE_WAIT_LIMIT_SECONDS` | 900 | Queue assignment |
| `SDI_HANDOFF_JENKINS_EXECUTION_LIMIT_SECONDS` | 5400 | Exact build execution |
| `SDI_HANDOFF_RETRIEVAL_LIMIT_SECONDS` | 300 | Complete artifact retrieval |
| `SDI_HANDOFF_RUNNER_OUTER_LIMIT_SECONDS` | 6000 | Complete handoff command |
| `SDI_HANDOFF_GITHUB_JOB_LIMIT_SECONDS` | 6600 | Enclosing GitHub job |

`SDI_HANDOFF_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` is an optional trusted polling control and
defaults to two seconds. These values are safety limits, not performance claims.
The GitHub job limit must exceed the runner outer limit so an always-run caller
can publish available evidence.

The command emits only sanitized phase transitions. It never retries a failed
HTTP operation or reconciles an ambiguous submission, and it never consults a
latest-build pointer. `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` causes one bounded cancellation POST
to the known queue item or exact build followed by a brief bounded observation
window when possible.

`handoff-receipt.json` is atomically updated outside the returned bundle as
queue and build facts become known. It contains relative Jenkins references,
never the private base URL or credentials. A `SUCCESS` build is accepted only
after complete schema, Execution-ID, path, size, digest, and undeclared-file
validation. A Jenkins `FAILURE` can still return a valid diagnostic bundle, but
the handoff exits unsuccessfully. `ABORTED`, missing, malformed, mismatched, or
incomplete evidence likewise fails with the available partial receipt.

The workflow captures the command's result record rather than printing it into
live logs, so the visible handoff output remains the native sanitized phase
sequence. Its always-run publication step uploads the validated bundle and
available receipt as the sole 90-day artifact named
`pipeline-integration-<execution_id>`.

After publication, `github-summary` independently validates the receipt and any
returned bundle, incorporates GitHub's handoff and publication outcomes, renders
the status-first summary, and returns the final machinery conclusion. It never
derives an aggregate Domain verdict. A result-less failed or cancelled handoff
is summarized from its receipt without promising Stage evidence. The Image build
section joins each image-build record with its deployment-schema placement, or
gives Image-build's conclusion and reason in one line when it recorded no result.

Authenticated operators can submit the reviewed six S-04 request paths
sequentially through the same workflow with:

```sh
uv run --frozen --project integration sdi-integration dispatch-s-04 \
  --repository open-SDI/ci-cv-cd_framework
```

The helper prints each exact run URL before waiting and stops on failed or
cancelled integration. It does not introduce a batch record or KPI
interpretation. See `docs/pipeline-integration-trigger.md` for all UI, CLI, and
REST trigger and retrieval procedures.

## Settled Failure Semantics

`dispatch-local` publishes a complete contract-valid bundle whenever finalization
remains possible. Handled failures, crashes, deadline expiry, rejected candidate
transactions, unavailable implementations, and blocked dependencies appear as
typed attempts; skipped attempts never imply that a process ran. Adapter or
deadline failures return status 1 after printing the result. A failed CV
or CD outcome also returns status 1, because CV found that the composition
fails or CD could not deploy it. Any other valid negative Domain outcome still
returns status 0 because adapter execution succeeded.

Candidate acceptance is transactional. A malformed, missing, changing, unsafe,
undeclared, oversized, identity-mismatched, or schema-invalid candidate
contributes no adapter-authored files. The resulting failed attempt explicitly
records that no adapter response was accepted. An implemented adapter cannot
consume unevaluated Fixture output, and a Fixture never consumes implemented
output. A negative Domain outcome publishes no Domain output.

External `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` cancellation is the deliberate exception: the CLI
immediately terminates the active adapter process tree, removes attempt-local and
bundle staging state, and publishes neither Stage attempts nor a Pipeline
integration result.
