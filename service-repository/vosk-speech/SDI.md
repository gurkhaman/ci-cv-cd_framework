## Purpose

Recognizes spoken English on the robot's CPU, without a network or GPU, and
publishes what was said as text, so that the robot can take spoken requests
and hear spoken replies.

## Capabilities

- Transcribes 16 kHz mono 16-bit audio from `/audio_listener/audio` with Vosk
  and its small US English model.
- Publishes one message on `/speech/text` per utterance: the recognized words,
  lower case and without punctuation. An utterance ends when no audio has
  arrived for about 500 ms.

## Assumptions and preconditions

- Another service provides `/audio_listener/audio` at 16 kHz (normally
  `audio-capture`), and stops sending between utterances. A continuous stream
  is cut into utterances only where Vosk itself detects a pause, and the text
  is published only after the stream stops.

## Limitations and known failure modes

- The small English model gives no accuracy guarantee: names, noisy rooms, and
  accented or distant speech are often misrecognized.
- The message is sent even when nothing was recognized, as an empty string.
- Recognizes English only, and reports no confidence, speaker, or language.

## Configuration notes

The recipe installs the Vosk 0.3.45 wheel from PyPI, pinned by hash for each
architecture, without its Python dependencies, which come from noble packages.
It downloads `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15` at build time and checks its sha256.
There are no parameters. The image lists its installed packages in
`/usr/share/sdi/installed-packages.txt`.

## Evaluation

None recorded.
