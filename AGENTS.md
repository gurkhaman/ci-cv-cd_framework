# Repository Guide

## Boundaries

- `integration/` is the supported Python project and owns the repository verification command. Run its commands from the directory stated below.
- `CI/` is an explicitly unsupported workspace. The implemented composition adapter lives in `integration/` as `sdi-composition-adapter`; the architecture in `CI/APSEC_2025_Tools.pdf` is design context, not implemented code.
- `service-repository/` is the SDI service repository: one `<service_id>/` service folder per mobility service, holding its `SDI.md` description and the recipes that build its artifacts. CI reads it as a supplied read-only path and never writes it.
- The Year-1 plugin and prototype were retired. Git history is their archive; do not restore their interfaces or artifact formats.
- Most tracked files are Gazebo assets under `CV/gazebo/models/`; avoid repository-wide formatting or generated-file rewrites there.

## Engineering Choices

- Prefer mature, actively maintained, purpose-built libraries for standard capabilities such as parsing and validation when they satisfy the project contract. Assess compatibility, security posture, licensing, and maintenance, then lock the selected version exactly.
- Build custom infrastructure only when no suitable library exists or project-specific semantics require it, and record that rationale in the implementing issue or code review.
- Contracts are unreleased during development; change schemas in place without bumping versions.

## Pipeline Integration Scaffold

- `integration/` requires Python `>=3.12,<3.13`, pins CPython 3.12.13 for development, and uses its own exact `uv.lock`.
- Run the deterministic repository checks from any directory with `integration/scripts/verify`. It performs frozen environment setup, generated-schema, Stage-profile, and Fixture-case freshness, Ruff formatting and linting, Basedpyright, pytest, and the ephemeral Jenkins stack smoke check (controller, five agents, builder, pipeline registry, and the handoff-runner image) on the supported Docker host.
- Full verify always runs the smoke check on `main` and on a branch with no commits beyond `origin/main`. On a branch with its own commits, it skips the smoke check when no changed, staged, or untracked file since the merge base is a smoke input. The `smoke_inputs` pattern in `integration/scripts/verify` owns that list, and verify prints which case applied.
- Run `integration/scripts/verify --fast` while you work. It skips the slow tests and the smoke check. Run the full `integration/scripts/verify` once before you open a pull request.
- Full verify takes the host lock `/tmp/sdi-host.lock` itself before the slow tests and the smoke check, so concurrent sessions on one host wait in turn. A `flock /tmp/sdi-host.lock` wrapper around verify is safe, because verify reuses the locked descriptor that `flock` passes down. A wrapper that closes inherited descriptors deadlocks. Examples are `flock -o` and a Python process that holds the lock and starts verify through `subprocess`, which closes inherited descriptors by default.
- The public entry point is `uv run --project integration sdi-integration`. The CLI, committed file contracts, and language-neutral Stage-adapter process interface are the supported boundaries; internal Python modules are not compatibility contracts.
- The current scaffold validates committed inputs and executes four Stages locally or through the protected GitHub workflow and thin root Jenkins pipeline on five isolated inbound agents. Composition is implemented: it calls the default generator, or the one `--generator` names, of the committed composition config (`integration/composition-config.yaml`) over the supplied service repository. The config's `qwen` generator is self-hosted for cheap live tests only. Image-build, CV, and CD remain Fixtures; their real adapters are deferred to dedicated implementation work.
- The composition live tests call a real model. Keep keys in the environment or the ignored root `.env`; never print, write, or commit them.
- `integration/src/sdi_pipeline_integration/_stage_registry.py` owns Stage wiring. One `Stage` row per Stage holds its grant, display name, agent, Jenkins and local descriptors, and credentials, and `AGENTS` and `RUN_LIMITS` sit beside the rows. Change a Stage fact only there, then regenerate with `sdi-integration jenkinsfile --write --jenkinsfile ../Jenkinsfile` and `sdi-integration stage-profiles --write` from `integration/`.

## Rules And Their Checks

Each rule has a check that fails when a change breaks it. When the operator corrects a repeated mistake, add the rule and its check in the same change, and prefer structure, types, or a lint whose message names the fix over prose. Drop a rule once its mistake cannot happen.

| Rule | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Import `openai` only inside the function that builds a client. | `integration/tests/test_import_cost.py` |
| Workflows under `.github/workflows/` pass actionlint. | `integration/tests/test_workflow_lint.py` |
| `Jenkinsfile` never uses `scm`; select the repository by `env.JOB_NAME` as `checkoutSubmittedCommit` does. | `test_committed_jenkinsfile_does_not_use_scm` in `integration/tests/test_jenkinsfile_lint.py` |
| `Jenkinsfile` calls only `sdi-integration` operations the CLI defines. | `test_committed_jenkinsfile_calls_only_defined_operations` in `integration/tests/test_jenkinsfile_lint.py` |
| Each Stage's descriptors name that Stage, and each Stage runs on its own agent. | `integration/tests/test_stage_registry.py` |
| The `Jenkinsfile` Stage block is generated from the Stage registry; never edit it by hand. | `sdi-integration jenkinsfile --check` in `integration/scripts/verify` |
| Hand-written Groovy outside the generated block names no Stage, agent label, or `adapters/` path. | `test_hand_written_groovy_names_no_stage_fact` in `integration/tests/test_jenkinsfile_lint.py` |
| JCasC nodes, Compose agent services, smoke-check agents, Job DSL parameters and job names, and the workflow `timeout-minutes` match the registry. | `integration/tests/test_stage_wiring.py` |
| Each Domain adapter defines `main = serve(stage, body)` from `_adapter_kit` and refuses wrong-Stage, oversized, and malformed requests. | `integration/tests/test_adapter_entry_points.py` and `integration/tests/test_adapter_conformance.py` |
| Per-Stage document checks live in `CHECKS` in `_stage_documents.py`, one `match` case per Stage. | Basedpyright, through `assert_never` in `_stage_check` |
| Verify prints Stage status from `sdi-integration stage-status`, never from hand-written text. | `integration/tests/test_repository_acceptance.py` |
| Markdown names only repository paths that exist or that git ignores. | `integration/tests/test_doc_paths.py` |

## Change And Review Workflow

- Treat one implementation issue as one review unit and start it from the latest merged `main`.
- Implement and verify only that issue, review the complete diff, and open one pull request against `main`.
- Keep issue, commit, branch, and pull-request references consistent with the repository's configured tracker and review policy.
- Begin blocked work only after its blocker is merged.

## CV Assets

- Gazebo files are source assets for an external TurtleBot3 workspace. Copy the world, model directories, and launch file into `turtlebot3_gazebo`, then run `colcon build --symlink-install` from `turtlebot3_ws` before `ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo office.launch.py`.
- The Gazebo assets are not wired into the pipeline integration scaffold and provide no automated scenario, oracle, or Validation evidence.
- `CV/gazebo/world_parser.py` executes on import. Run it only from `CV/gazebo`; it copies model trees into the ignored `_models/` directory.

## Generated And Local Files

- `.gitignore` excludes Python caches and environments, generated artifacts, workspaces, recovery artifacts, local deployment configuration, runtime secrets, and Gazebo parser output without hiding committed schemas or Fixture cases.
- The active root `Jenkinsfile` schedules only public integration CLI operations across the five agents. `.github/workflows/pipeline-integration.yml` is the protected external trigger, progress, summary, and artifact-retrieval surface.
- Check `git status` after commands and keep machine-specific values, secrets, generated evidence, and recovery state out of commits.
