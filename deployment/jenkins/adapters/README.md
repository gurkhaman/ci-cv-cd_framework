# Adapter Descriptors

Reviewed descriptors select a Stage, Implementation mode, digest-pinned image,
process-contract version, Stage-profile version, agent label, entry point, and
logical secret bindings. Secret values and Jenkins credential identifiers are
governed separately and never enter these contracts.

`composition-v1.yaml` selects the implemented `sdi-composition-adapter`. Its
`secret_bindings` name the environment variables a generation config may use for
its key; the runtime forwards only the one the config names. The image-build,
CV, and CD Fixture descriptors receive no secrets and select one shared
digest-pinned Fixture implementation through separate reviewed Stage profiles.
Each Domain-agent build consumes its own descriptor-selected runtime image, so a
later reviewed descriptor can replace and reconcile one agent independently.
The `ci` node identity exposes the descriptor's `composition` label; the other
three node identities and logical labels match.
